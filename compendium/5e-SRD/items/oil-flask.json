  "description": "Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint.\\nAs an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon.\\nOn a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil.\\nYou can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level.\\nIf lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.",
