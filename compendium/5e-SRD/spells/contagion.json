On a hit, you afflict the creature with a disease of your choice from any of the ones described below.\\nAt the end of each of the target's turns, it must make a constitution saving throw. After failing three of these saving throws, the disease's effects last for the duration, and the creature stops making these saves. After succeeding on three of these saving throws, the creature recovers from the disease, and the spell ends.\\nSince this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease's effects apply to it.\\nBlinding Sickness.\\nPain grips the creature's mind, and its eyes turn milky white.
